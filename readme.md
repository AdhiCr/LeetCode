# Readme

This repository is a collection of my solutions to the different problems listed under the learn section of 
[LeetCode - Explore](https://leetcode.com/explore/).

I chose the problems based on the [Explore card track](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/the-leetcode-beginners-guide/679/sql-syntax/4358/)
from LeetCode.

Each section has a dedicated directory to it, and each problem has a dedicated sub-directory which would usually will
contain:
1. The "problem_statement" along with any of the given hints
2. The solution - if applicable it'll be marked speed or memory, 
   * memory: most memory efficient implementation by me 
   * speed: fastest implementation by me
   * both: most memory efficient + fastest implementation by me
   * i.e., There are possibly even faster and/or more efficient solutions out there

All solutions are in **Python3**

<sup>1,2</sup>: The rankings for speed and memory usage are directly taken from LeetCode "Submission Details" sheet 
obtained as on the date of submission (rankings reported only on Python3 based submissions).

<sup>3</sup>: Submitting the same code a few times resulted in slightly varying results, the best speed and memory are reported together here. This also indicates the metrics reported by LeetCode are not consistent, and there by consider them only as a general indication of performance
