# Readme

This repository is a collection of my solutions to the different problems listed under the learn section of 
[LeetCode - Explore](https://leetcode.com/explore/).

I chose the problems based on the [Explore card track](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/the-leetcode-beginners-guide/679/sql-syntax/4358/)
from LeetCode.

Each section has a dedicated directory to it, and each problem has a dedicated sub-directory which would usually will
contain:
1. The "problem_statement" along with any of the given hints
2. The solution - if applicable it'll be marked speed or memory, 
   * memory: most memory efficient implementation by me 
   * speed: fastest implementation by me 
   * i.e., There are possibly even faster and/or more efficient solutions out there

All solutions are in **Python3**

### Order of problems:
 * Arrays 101
